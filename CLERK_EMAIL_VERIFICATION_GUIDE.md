# Email Verification Guide for Ziq

This guide explains how to configure Clerk to require email verification for all new users, preventing anonymous users from abusing your system.

## Why Email Verification is Important

- **Prevents Abuse**: Requiring email verification reduces fake accounts and credit system abuse
- **Improves User Trust**: Verified users lead to a more trustworthy community
- **Enables Communication**: Allows you to send important updates and notifications
- **Facilitates Account Recovery**: Makes it easier for users to recover lost accounts

## Handling Existing Users

For existing users without verified emails, we've implemented a gentle reminder system:

- A non-intrusive dialog will appear for users without a verified email
- Users can add an email address or dismiss the reminder
- Dismissed reminders will reappear after 7 days
- This approach respects existing users while encouraging email verification

## Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse
2. **Credit System Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual patterns in credit usage
3. **IP Tracking**: Track IP addresses for suspicious activity
4. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review user accounts for potential abuse
